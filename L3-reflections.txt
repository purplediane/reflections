1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  a. The remote repository acts as a backup
  b. You can share your work easily if you want.
  c. Other people can contribute easily.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might be in the middle of making changes that would get wiped out if Git kept the two places up to date automatically.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	When you want an independent version of a repository on github, use fork. It remembers where it came from, but that is all. 
	Cloning makes another version of a repository. Depending on where it was cloned from, you may be able to push changes to your clone to the original repo.
	Branches are local and are for new versions of files that may or may not be merged into the master repo, either local or remote.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
	You can work offline, without internet access or at least without access to the remote repository.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
	It would be difficult without some kind of version control. I would establish ownership of certain files to certain people. Then if A wanted to change a file owned by B, A would have to contact B and have B merge A's changes. It would really be annoying. 

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
	With using separate branches and pull requests, there is less likelihood that a change is going to break everything. Other people can look at the pull requests and comment on them. In the case of code, you want people to review changes before they are merged into master production code.
