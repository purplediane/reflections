1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  a. The remote repository acts as a backup
  b. You can share your work easily if you want.
  c. Other people can contribute easily.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You might be in the middle of making changes that would get wiped out if Git kept the two places up to date automatically.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
	When you want an independent version of a repository on github, use fork. It remembers where it came from, but that is all. 
	Cloning makes another version of a repository. Depending on where it was cloned from, you may be able to push changes to your clone to the original repo.
	Branches are local and are for new versions of files that may or may not be merged into the master repo, either local or remote.
