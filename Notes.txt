Created a repository on github. Now to update it with local repository:

$ cd ../Reflections/
diane (master) Reflections $ git remote add origin https://github.com/purplediane/reflections.git
diane (master) Reflections $ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/reflections.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/reflections.git (push)
diane (master) Reflections $ git push -u origin master

Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.
diane (master) Reflections $ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/reflections.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/reflections.git (push)

Now both locations have the 2 files, L1-reflections.txt and L2-reflections.txt

On github, I added a new file, L3-reflections.txt with the lesson 3 prompts copied from the download file. Now I want to bring it local.

diane (master) Reflections $ git pull origin master

After making local changes, I want to put the changes up to github

diane (master) Reflections $ git push

======================================================

I forked a recipes repository on github, then copied the "HTTPS clone URL" from my own new github repository. Then I used that to make a local repo:
diane (master) Reflections $ cd ..
diane UsingGit $ git clone https://github.com/purplediane/recipes.git
Cloning into 'recipes'...
remote: Counting objects: 13, done.
remote: Total 13 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 13

diane UsingGit $ cd recipes
diane (master) recipes $ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/recipes.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/purplediane/recipes.git (push)

Then I added a new recipe, and commmitted it locally:

diane (master) recipes $ git add TortillaSoup.txt
diane (master +) recipes $ git commit -m "New recipe for Tortilla Soup"
[master da08301] New recipe for Tortilla Soup
 1 file changed, 17 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 TortillaSoup.txt

Now I want to move it up to github:

diane (master) recipes $ git push origin master
Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 648 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/purplediane/recipes.git
   a6a2f99..da08301  master -> master

Now I edit the chili recipe and make a change. Meanwhile, Sarah from the Udacity course also makes a change (it was done with the shell script in the UsingGit folder). So we have conflicts, although we don't know yet. But we got notified that Sarah made a change to the github repo, so we know there is a conflict. We use git fetch to update our local version of the remote repo without affecting the local master branch we changed.

"git pull origin master" is the same thing as saying
git fetch origin
git merge master origin/master

The pull uses fetch to get a local copy of the remote origin, then it is merged with the local master.

So now we want to cehck the chanes that were made in the github repo:

diane (master) recipes $ git fetch origin
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 1 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/purplediane/recipes
   da08301..1bb6290  master     -> origin/master

To see the differences between the new remote origin and the local master:

diane (master) recipes $ git diff origin/master master

To merge the changes:
diane (master) recipes $ git merge master origin/master
Auto-merging chili-recipe.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in chili-recipe.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

Edit the chili-recipe.txt file and fix the merge.

diane (master *+|MERGING) recipes $ git add chili-recipe.txt
diane (master +|MERGING) recipes $ git commit
[master 72b02e6] Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master'
diane (master) recipes $ 

We could have just done "git pull origin/master" but this showed the git fetch command.

============================

create new branch, edit a file & commit

diane (master) recipes $ git checkout new-oil 
Switched to branch 'new-oil'

edit the file

diane (new-oil *) recipes $ git add cake-recipe.txt
diane (new-oil +) recipes $ git commit -m "Use Canola oil"
[new-oil d6106f5] Use Canola oil
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

push the branch to github

diane (new-oil) recipes $ git push origin new-oil

 * [new branch]      new-oil -> new-oil

Now on github, use the branches pull-down to "checkout" the new-oil branch, and click on "pull request".
>>>>>>>>>NOTE<<<<<<<<<< IMPORTANT
Be sure to select the correct base! By default it will be the forked repository!
Then, create pull request.
From the repo, you can see the pull requests. I made a comment due to a typo that I don't want to merge into master.
Now, locally, I fix the typo and commit the change; still in the new-oil branch & push to github:

diane (new-oil) recipes $ git status
On branch new-oil
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   cake-recipe.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
diane (new-oil *) recipes $ git commit -a -m "Fix typo in canola"
[new-oil c5b3f52] Fix typo in canola

   d6106f5..c5b3f52  new-oil -> new-oil

Now we go back to github. There has been another change! Using the shell script, we simulate a change made by Sarah:
bash sarah_changes_2.sh https://github.com/purplediane/recipes.git
This is similar to what we did earlier. Now, we pull those changes into local master. When we try to merge we get a merge conflict.

diane (new-oil) recipes $ git checkout master
