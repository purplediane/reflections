1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git creates the .git directory to track changes to the files. If you don't do this, then git has no way of treating the directory as a repository.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is just a concept of which files in the working directory are ready to be committed to the repository. It is useful to keep track of changes and what files should go into the next commit.

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You only add files to the staging area that belong in the next commit. Other files can stay in the working directory for staging/commit later.
